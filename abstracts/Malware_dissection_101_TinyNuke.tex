What is a banking trojan ? How does it work ? Let's dissect a TinyNuke sample to find it out.

Last year, a massive malware campaign have been spotted targeting French and American banks.
This banking trojan called TinyNuke or NukeBot targets American and French bank customers in order to steal credentials by keylogging. The presentation will cover a quick analysis of TinyNuke to understand how it works. So we will talk about basic malware analysis method including lab setup, macro word deobfuscation, basic anti-debugg bypass, dynamic analysis and finding IoCs. The goal of this presentation is to show that nowadays malwares are not always as tricky as we might think. Some are still basic and easy to dissect for beginners.
