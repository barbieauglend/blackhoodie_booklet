\thispagestyle{abstract}

In this talk, we present JaSt, a low-overhead solution that combines the extraction of features from the abstract syntax tree with a random forest classifier to detect malicious JavaScript instances. Even though the analysis is entirely static, it yields a high detection accuracy of almost 99.5\% and has a low false-negative rate of 0.54\%.
