Rooting detection mechanisms implemented by Android applications can be a pitfall for reverse-engineers who want to study these applications. This presentation aims at sharing an interesting way based on Google Play emulator debugging to get a rooted shell not trivially detectable by the applications allowing to go further in reverse-engineering (RE).
