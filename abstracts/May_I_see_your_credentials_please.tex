Credential theft is an important part of the attacker playbook when attempting lateral movement. This process mostly involves dumping credentials saved locally on the machine. In many cases these passwords can be retrieve from the Windows Credential Manager, allowing attackers an easy path into the organization. This was evident in major attacks such as the NotPetya ransomware, and high-profile tools like Mimikatz.
In this talk, we explain how to detect credential theft out of the Windows Credential Manager using Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). This involves modifying the Windows operating system to send telemetry to the WDATP cloud which was extended with new detection rules.
