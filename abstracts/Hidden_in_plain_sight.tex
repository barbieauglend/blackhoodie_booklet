This talk will take a look at some living-off-the-land techniques and fileless persistence methods in Windows. Tools that are already installed on a system provide a good opportunity to hide in plain sight and Windows gives us various options to 'legitimately' play around.
The overall goal is to point to interesting fields worth taking a closer look at later on.
