  \textbf{Prerequisites}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Firm understanding of operating systems and computer architecture concepts.
    \item Exposure to x86 and x64 assembly and C language is assumed.
    \item Familiarity with debugging and reversing frameworks.
    \item Grasp of the TCP/IP protocols.
    \item Familiarity with VMware/VirtualBox and be able to import and configure virtual machines.
    \item Technical requirements for the specific workshops will be communicated in advance.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{No need to have dealt with x86 before.}\\

  \textbf{Description}\\

  This track includes workshops that we don't think beginners will find entertaining, since they require some understanding of topics listed above already. Typically former attendees bring mentioned requirements already. Workshops might tackle Windows kernel, ARM exploitation, one or another little hacking challenge. (TBC.)\\

  \textbf{Workshops}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cryptography for Non-Cryptographers by Marion Videau
    \item Introduction to Return Oriented Programming by chiliz
